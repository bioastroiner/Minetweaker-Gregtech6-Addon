## Materials
Materials Lists and way of handeling all the registered materials in GT6.
import the `mods.gregtech.oredict.Material` class to get started.

Use the `<material:name>` to retrive it ~~you can also pass the ID.~~(to be implemented)

for bundled Material Use the `mods.gregtech.oredict.MaterialStack` class;
it can also be retrived by multiplying a Material by a number.
```zs
<material:gold>.amount(0.5); // 2 small dusts
```

# For Now There is no way of adding materials using zs soon i will add feature for that if needed
